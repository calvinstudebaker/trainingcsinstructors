      <h3>Why is getting students to talk important?</h3>

      <p>"Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn." - Herb Simon, Nobel Laureate and Artificial Intelligence expert</p>

      <p>Getting students to talk promotes learning. This happens because talk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Makes thinking visible for both the instructor and the student. You are able to see what they do and do not understand</li>
        <li>Pushes students to explain and clarify their ideas using evidence and logic</li>
        <li>Requires students to understand and critique ideas from other students in order to improve on them and achieve shared understanding</li>
        <li>Builds confidence and willingness to take risks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What could a productive discussion look like in computer science?</h3>
      <p>As you watch this video, look for strategies the instructor uses to get students to talk and how the talk leads to insights for students.</p>
      <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-HCmMwLmad4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

      <br/>
      <p>Here's the same problem discussed in a way that is less productive for student learning. As you watch, look for places where the instructor hindered discussion and think of what she could've done better.</p>
      <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgfZryj3yfE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

      <h3>How do I create a culture where students feel comfortable talking?</h3>
      <p>First, you need to believe that the students (not the instructor) are the ones who should be doing the majority of the talking.</p>
      <p>Then, set clear expectations for discussions. Tell your students that discussions will be a normal part of the classroom, so you expect them to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contribute to discussions by discussing ideas not people</li>
        <li>Listen and respond respectfully to others</li>
        <li>Speak loudly so everyone can hear them</li>
        <li>Ask questions when they’re confused</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lastly, create regular opportunities for open-ended discussions where you reinforce these expectations for participation. So, if a student is not meeting an expectation during a discussion, you should stop to gently remind them.</p>

      <h3>What are proven strategies for getting students to talk?</h3>
      <p>There are many strategies (or “talk moves”) that you can use with your students. As you consider which moves might be most effective with your students, keep in mind that you don’t need to use all of them in every discussion. Pick one or two to try out for your next discussion, and then, over time, include more of the talk moves in your facilitation.</p>

      <h4>Share, expand, clarify:</h4>
      <p>Ask all students to share and elaborate on their ideas out loud</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Wait time:</b> Wait a few seconds after asking a question to give students time to think about their answers</li>
        <li><b>Stop and jot:</b> Give students time to think with a few minutes to jot down ideas before discussing</li>
        <li><b>Partner time:</b> Have students share their thoughts with a partner and then share a key point from their mini-discussion with the larger group</li>
        <li><b>“Say more”:</b> Ask a student to elaborate on their idea by saying, “Can you say a little more about that?”</li>
        <li><b>“So, are you saying…?”:</b> Revoice a student’s idea to push them to clarify their thinking. The student can agree or disagree with you and then say more.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <h4>Deepen their reasoning:</h4> 
      <p>Push students to deepen their reasoning with evidence and logic</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Probe for evidence/reasoning:</b> Ask a student to explain how they arrived at their reasoning by providing more evidence. You can say, “Why?” or “Why do you think that?”</li>
        <li><b>Challenge or counterexample:</b> Push on a student’s idea by giving counterexamples to understand if something always work the way the student is suggesting. The goal isn’t to tell the student that they’re wrong, but rather to complexify their thinking</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <h4>Listen carefully:</h4> 
      <p>Encourage students to listen carefully to one another so they can be prepared to build on each other’s thinking</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Repeat and rephrase:</b> Ask students to put into their own words what another student has said</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <h4>Think with others:</h4> 
      <p>Get students to talk to one another instead of the instructor in order to improve the thinking of the entire group</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Agree/Disagree and Why?:</b> Push students to engage with the ideas of others by asking who agrees or disagrees with the idea presented and to share why</li>
        <li><b>Add on:</b> Ask students to build on or add on to the ideas of another student, “Who can add on to his idea?”</li>
      </ul>

      Productive discussions don’t just happen. They go smoothly because we prepare for them in advance by considering multiple ways to solve a problem, how we’ll guide students through a problem, where students might get confused, and which talk moves we’ll employ. Here are a list of questions to consider as your prepare for your next discussion.
    </p>

    <h3>Use this guide to plan a discussion for each practice problem</h3>

        <h5>Example Problem: Subsequences</h5>
        <p><div class="text-muted"> (Source: Stanford University. (2015). Retrieved May 31, 2015, from https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/sections/section03.pdf)</div></p>
        <br>
        <p>Write a function <code>bool isSubsequence(string big, string small)</code> that takes two strings and returns if the second string (small) is a subsequence of the first string (big). A string is a subsequence of another if it contains the same letters in the same order, but not necessary consecutively. You can assume both strings are already lowercased.
        <br><br>
        Test Cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>isSubsequence("computer", "core") => false</code></li>
          <li><code>isSubsequence("computer", "cope") => true</code></li>
          <li><code>isSubsequence("computer", "computer") => true</code></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
      
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Understand the problem</li></h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>How would you solve the problem?</b></li>
        <p>It's important to make sure you've worked completely through the problem before working with students. Even if you think you can eyeball a solution, take time to write it down, just in case there's a "twist" in the problem that you don't initially see.</p>

        <li><b>What is another way (or two) to solve the problem?</b></li>
        <p>Sometimes, as experts, we tend to quickly see a working solution and think that’s the best and perhaps the only correct way to solve the problem. In some cases, there may only be one correct solution, but in many cases, there are alternative ways to solve the problem that also work. In order to support our students, it’s important that we take time to consider alternative ways to approach a problem so we can more effectively guide them towards <i>a</i> working solution, not just the one working solution that we see.</p>
      </ol>

      <h3><li>Plan the discussion</li></h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>How will you start the discussion?</b></li>
        <p>Here are a few options to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have students work for several minutes individually on the problem so they have time to form their own ideas about how to approach it. They don't need to solve the problem before having a class discussion.</li> 
          <li>Review relevant concepts, like we do in the example discussion video in the Understand tab</li>
          <li>Have students work in small groups to understand the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From these initial activities, you could go on to have a class discussion about how to solve the problem.</p>

        <li><b>What expectations have you (or will you) set for discussions? How can you set and/or reinforce them?</b></li> 
        <p>Here are some expectations to considering sharing with students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute to discussions by discussing ideas not people</li>
          <li>Listen and respond respectfully to others</li>
          <li>Speak loudly so everyone can hear them</li>
          <li>Ask questions when they’re confused</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>How will you guide students through the problem?</b></li>
        <p>We recommend following this problem solving process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the problem by writing down the given information and defining example functionality (i.e. key use cases)</li>
          <li>Review related concepts and analogies</li>
          <li>Plan a solution by first writing the algorithm in English and/or pseudocode</li>
          <li>Build the solution in code</li>
          <li>Test the solution on the example functionality</li>
          <li>Iterate/update the algorithm and code until the solution works as expected</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <h3>Practice your lesson plan!</h3>
      <p>Now that you've spent time planning out how you'll lead a discussion for each problem, it's time to practice. It is important to practice your lesson before heading into section so that you can verbalize your lesson ahead of time and catch areas that need improvement. If others are online, videochat with them below to lead a practice discussion. If not, practice out loud on your own. Once you are done, reflect on the exercise and take note of what changes you plan to make for the actual lesson.</p>
