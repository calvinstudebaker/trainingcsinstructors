          <h3>Does it matter if students talk in class?</h3>
          <h4>Yes!</h4>
          <p>"Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn." - Herb Simon, Nobel Laureate and Artificial Intelligence expert</p>

          <p><b>Getting students to talk promotes their learning.</b></p> 

          <p>Discussions allow instructors to gauge students' conceptual understanding and problem solving abilities as they grapple with ideas and questions together. Their understanding and problem solving process improve through the immediate feedback from classmates and instructors.</p>

          <p><b>By making time for problem solving discussions, we better prepare students to solve complex problems in the future.</b></p>
